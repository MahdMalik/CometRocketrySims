There is a 90% chance that the mean of the Apogee Altitude falls within THIS RANGE: 2868.9840560887505, 2868.9840560887505

We have the hypothesis that our mean is greater than or equal to 3048. With our critical percent, our critical value is -1.6448536269514729. Then, our test statistic is -inf
Since our test statistic is more extreme than our critical value, we can reject the null hypothesis that the mean is 3048.
