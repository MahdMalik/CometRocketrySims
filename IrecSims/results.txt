There is a 90% chance that the mean of the Apogee Altitude falls within THIS RANGE: 2954.3987768531947, 2955.0256675125224

We have the hypothesis that our mean is greater than or equal to 3048. With our critical percent, our critical value is -1.6448536269514729. Then, our test statistic is -489.54227474827155
Since our test statistic is more extreme than our critical value, we can reject the null hypothesis that the mean is 3048.
