We have the hypothesis that our mean is greater than or equal to 3048. With our critical percent, our critical value is -1.6448536269514729. Then, our test statistic is -3.7442980902940497
Since our test statistic is more extreme than our critical value, we can reject the null hypothesis that the mean is 3048.
